MyBlindAmbition
====================
### Intro

I launched my first portfolio site in 2006 as part of the May 1st Reboot. 10 years later they decided to reboot the 'boot and it seemed like a perfect time to refresh my personal site. Unfortunately, I ended up being super busy at work and never got around to working on it. The morning of April 30th I woke up with an idea and managed to throw this site together in one day, working only when my 1.5 yr old was sleeping. All said and done I think I clocked ~10-11 hours on this before launching at 2am May 1st, 2016. I may eventually get around to updating the site as I wanted to have it fluidly controlled by scrolling. That can take time get right so for now the animations are driven by simple click events.

The site is built on top of my webGL framework called Aero. (https://github.com/Oblioio/AeroJS) It's kind of a wierd framework and may not make sense due to the face that there is currently no documentation. 

### Process

The assets folder within the roots contains the assets I used to create the triangulated background imagery. A quick explaination:

* I ran the original photos (assets/photos) through DMesh (http://dmesh.thedofl.com/) and saved out the generated pdfs (assets/pdf)
* I took the pdfs into illustrator (assets/photos.ai) which I used to output svgs of each (assets/svg)
* I wrote a node script (assets/svgProcess.js) that loaded the svgs, read the color and points of each triangle and saved out json files containing a single array that is ready to upload directly into a webGL buffer. The node script also adds extra triangles to the images so that they all have a matching number. This way I can just transition from one image to the next by interpolating the points in a vertex shader.

### Setup

To run the app build you'll need to have bower installed, then you can run bower install from the command line to install the neccesary dependencies.

To create a distribution build you'll need node and grunt installed. First run npm install to install the required modules, then run grunt build to create the dist build. NOTE: Currently there is a stupid bug that makes the dist build not work. If you update main.js so it reads '../assets/jsPrograms' instead of 'assets/jsPrograms' then it should build correctly. It's ghetto but I didn't have time to figure out what the deal was.
